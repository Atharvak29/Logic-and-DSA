# Number-guessing-game-1
Python code that to run a game to guess correct number beteen 1 to 100 with hints


‚ò†Ô∏è
Main problem I had while writting this code was
getting variable values out from a funtion 
and the next problem I had was the logical problem of finding the value to 
multipy or divide my number with to get the answer


Next time I can use more functions üòé
